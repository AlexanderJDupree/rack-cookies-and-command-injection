## Introduction

This repo contains a the source code and notes for the [Pentester Labs](https://pentesterlab.com/) Rack cookies and Command Injection exploit.
This exploit reverse engineers a Ruby rack cookie and modifies it in order to gain administrator privileges. After which, we exploit the administer
interface to gain command execution on the server.
